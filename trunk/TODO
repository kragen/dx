D make autoformat (autolinkify) turn \n into <br>

D there's some kind of bug where sometimes all the post timestamps
  display as the timestamp of the backup! Not cool. (CSS namespace
  collision: '.timestamp' used for both.)

D refactor post types to remove duplicated code

D rename for now to "Disco Bridge".

D rename to "Disco Explorer"

- do something sensible with schemeless links

    - for me to repro this, Rohit needs to give me his JSON and I need
      to be able to restore it

- actually extract the domain name from links

D add another post type: notes

- come up with a better name

- back up friendships too

- back up photos too -- mostly b/c we don't have a good way to back up. Tell people to save as .mht? really?

- back up comments on our posts &c. too

- back up albums too -- very important for visual appeal of thumbs (and comments on photos)

- make "progress bar" with a list of all the data elements to get,
  checkmarks by the ones obtained, spinners by those currently being
  refreshed, maybe use dimming and strikethrough to indicate those not
  yet implemented and/or not implementable

- or at least have SOME kind of throbber

- make export use a textarea?

- add a "post status to your wall" button

X how well do we handle dates in the near future? They all get
  displayed as "right now", which is suboptimal but okay.

- do automatic updates?

- versioning: prevent loss of old backups when new ones are loaded

- fix date strings to be more useful (not just "last year")

- bold search string occurrences?

- what if the owner description is null for a link? you get this:

    > **apophenia: gender gap in perception of computer science** null  
    > last year

- consider moving from localStorage to CouchDB a la
  <http://edparcell.posterous.com/using-jquery-and-couchdb-to-build-a-simple-we>
  or move to S3 using form POST to create short-lived files:
  <http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1434>

D scoping storage: prefix keys in localStorage with a common prefix,
  or store everything under a single key?

- if we start getting traffic, we should consider a "send stats to
  help the developers?" stage

- add a uservoice link like the "Support" one on the news sidebar

- what do we do if there is no localStorage etc. implementation
  available? We should provide some kind of error message.

- feedback from watching Beatrice use it:

    - "I don't know what to search for"

    - the JSON export doesn't work very well in Safari

    - "What do I do with this?" (the JSON export)

    - the search is "really nice and fast"

    - "I don't want to reload the page because it'll take forever to get all that stuff" (hopefully fixed)

    - "it's really cool"

    D "Statuses? Status messages."

    - Use the standard big green download button! (Maybe would
      increase Smruti's confusion: "Am I downloading software?")

    - spinner while loading? 

- BUG: we saw a hang with firefox 3.6.3, win xp ushankar: I made sure
      knx.to, facebook and googleapis are allowed in noscript. We
      failed hard, over 15 min of remote IM support, I could find no
      sign of any correct behavior except that the show-tools link
      worked; and that "no statuses" would appear after page load

D Analytics: make sure to bring over the analytics code, at least!

- request extended permissions to read_stream (no)
