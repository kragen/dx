bD stick an FQL console into Disconnect

- request extended permissions to read_stream (no)

D write FQL to save a copy of all of the user's status messages

D factor out the localStorage/globalStorage thing from knx.js

D write some piece of code to display old status messages (now I am
  wishing I had finished my template system rewrite, or that we'd
  adopted MJT, already)

D save the old status messages into local/globalStorage

D write something to search the status messages

- pull other kinds of data: notes? links?

    - starting with links.

        D `select link_id,owner,owner_comment,created_time,title,summary,url,image_urls from link where owner = 1173721181`

        D make Link and Status classes implementing a "post protocol":
          `.render() -> HTML`, `.time_t() -> int`, and
          `.matches(string) -> bool`

        D persist not the heterogeneous collection of posts, but the
          FQL results.

        D make a collection of posts that contains all currently known
          posts, which updates when new queries finish.

        D change search to run over the posts instead of the status
          messages

        D make link template look like FB's

    - notes

    - comments on above object ids?

    - albums  -- very important for visual appeal of thumbs (and comments on photos)

    - friendships

    - photos -- mostly b/c we don't have a good way to back up. Tell people to save as .mht? really?

D rename erase button

D make search work for links

D do the right search at page load time

D make unified "download everything" button

    D write function to ensure session and get both statuses and links

    D hide most other buttons by default

    D hide search by default

D hide "log out" button when you're not logged in

D hide "delete local backup" button when there is no local backup

D hide "json export in popup" button when there's nothing to export

D rename display_status_messages!

D remove extra call to it in the initialization function

D rename retrieve_status_messages

- make "progress bar" with a list of all the data elements to get,
  checkmarks by the ones obtained, spinners by those currently being
  refreshed, maybe use dimming and strikethrough to indicate those not
  yet implemented and/or not implementable

- or at least have SOME kind of throbber

D refactor replicas.on_change(a, b) to replicas.channel(a).on_change(b)

D add_me: find out username, for use in templates

- do something sensible with schemeless links

- make export use a textarea?

- add a "post status to your wall" button

- how well do we handle dates in the near future?

- do automatic updates?

- versioning

- fix date strings to be more useful

D clear:left

- bold search string occurrences?

- what if the owner description is null for a link? you get this:

    > **apophenia: gender gap in perception of computer science** null  
    > last year

- consider moving from localStorage to CouchDB a la
  <http://edparcell.posterous.com/using-jquery-and-couchdb-to-build-a-simple-we>
  or move to S3 using form POST to create short-lived files:
  <http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1434>

- scoping storage: prefix keys in localStorage with a common prefix,
  or store everything under a single key?

- if we start getting traffic, we should consider a "send stats to
  help the developers?" stage

- add a uservoice link like the "Support" one on the news sidebar

- what do we do if there is no localStorage etc. implementation
  available? We should provide some kind of error message.

- feedback from watching Beatrice use it:

    - the current big button doesn't look enough like a button (fixed)

    - the "log out" link (before you've logged in!) is distracting (fixed)

    - "I don't know what to search for"

    - the JSON export doesn't work very well in Safari

    - "What do I do with this?" (the JSON export)

    - the search is "really nice and fast"

    - "I don't want to reload the page because it'll take forever to get all that stuff" (hopefully fixed)

    - "it's really cool"

    - "Statuses? Status messages."

    - Use the standard big green download button!

    - spinner while loading? 

- BUG: we saw a hang with firefox 3.6.3, win xp ushankar: I made sure
      knx.to, facebook and googleapis are allowed in noscript. We
      failed hard, over 15 min of remote IM support, I could find no
      sign of any correct behavior except that the show-tools link
      worked; and that "no statuses" would appear after page load

- Analytics: make sure to bring over the analytics code, at least!

- Items from Yelena chat:

    - Fix copy. See files for latest.

    - Add title graphic.

    - add ability to remove dev tools

    - remove “no search results found” when nothing to search. also, "no stuff found"

    - add "Congratulations! Here is your stuff as of XXX, X days ago, and
      it has been backed up! Click here to bring that backup up to date."
      or "No backup yet."

    - change logout link to "log out of facebook"

    - put logout button in upper right-hand corner

    - add copyright notices

    - how to clarify that your backup is available even if you aren’t
      logged in to Facebook?

    - simplify CSS
